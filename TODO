ISSUES:

* Want the shipping category (standard, expedited) on the packing slip
   along with the condition notes.

* Need to *never* choke and die on a dazzle xml file.

* What to do if some of the condition notes are not retrievable?

* Still don't understand international shipping.

* Need some way to set the zip of where the packages will mail from
   different from the return address on the label.
