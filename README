The Rogue Book Exchange is a free bookstore in Medford Oregon (see 
http://www.roguebooks.org)

They pay their rent by selling a small percentage of the books donated
via amazon and other online used book venues (the rest of the donated
books go out on the shelves for anyone who wants them.)  RBE has used
Booksku (see http://booksku.com) as their inventory management and sales
system since inception.  At some point standing around at the postoffice 
all the time got old, and so they started using endicia as a print-your-own-postage
service.  There is a handy XML format to pass data from booksku to endicia
to print postage and address labels.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite 
work right.

This project contains the script written to massage the dazzle formatted 
file that booksku generates into a form that makes endicia happier.
