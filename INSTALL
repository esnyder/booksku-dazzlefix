2/3/2009 - Worked on installing on the RBE machine.

* Downloaded the python2.6 installer from the python.org site
  (python.com is a porn site.  careful!)  Installed to the default
  location of C:\Python26

* Added C:\Python26 to the system Path environmental variable (control
  panels -> system -> ?)

* Downloaded latest release of BeautifulSoup (3.?) and installed (cd
  BeautifulSoup-<version>; python setup.py install)

* Placed dazzlefix.py and dazzle_layout.lyt in
  C:\Users\Volunteer\Documents, opened a command prompt and cd'ed to
  there.)

* Download dazzle file from booksku and placed there as well.

* Now you're set to go:
  'python dazzlefix.py -b 10 -p <booksku password> -l 100
  <order-N.xml>'

* First attempt there was a weird non-ascii character in the xml file
  that caused the xml parser to choke.  It tells you the line and
  column that the problem was encountered.  Opened the file with
  Notepad++ and saw that it was a crazy symbol in someone's email
  address.  Changed it to '??', and reran.

* Now the beautiful soup is erorring out.  Downgraded to version ??
  (3.6 or something?  released early summer of '08) and reran.
  Produces <order-N.fixed.xml>

* Works.

* Now open Dazzle (from start menu).  It should use the
  c:\users\volunteers\documents\dazzle_layout.lyt by default, open the
  layout if it doesn't.

* Select File -> Print from external file, select XML in the dropdown
  of file types, then select the <order-N.fixed.xml> file produced
  above.

* It will re-write the data in the layout, and you will see a preview
  of the first order behind the print dialog.  If it looks good, you
  can print.  CAREFUL, THIS IS WHEN ENDICIA DEBITS OUR ACCOUNT, NO
  REFUNDS.
